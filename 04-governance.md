# Governance

Token emission related parameters should accomodate changes in user participation. 

The values used in practice reflect a 30-day EMA of the stake weighted daily mean of votes. The nature of this recency biased mechanism forces the stakeholders to pay attention and actively participate. The EMA is used to smooth out the day-to-day differences.

### Game variables set by stakeholders trough a governance contract

| Variable                           | Initial Value         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Daily Pre-VIEW balance top-up      | 10 PVT                |
| Daily VIEW token rewards pool      | 10,000 VIEW (3.6M/yr) |
| Creator / Voter rewards pool split | 9 : 1                 |

### Using TCRs for Community Moderation

Community **moderators are elected and managed by token holders** with Token Curated Registries (TCRs).

The role of the moderators is to protect the common good (rewards pool) from abuse. The moderators have the power to vote on, and with consensus reject or disqualify users who are violating the community gudelines and/or using bots and fake accounts to pillage the rewards pool.
