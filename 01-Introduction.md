## Introduction

Most common ways to distribute crypto tokens today are ICO's and Airdrops. 

ICO's are useful for raising funds for ambitious projects, however the tokens distributed through an ICO end up in hands of a few *(usually less than 100)* wealthy individuals and VC's. Such distribution is prone to centralization of power (oligopoly) and usually comes with inherent mis-alignment of interests between major stakeholders and actual token users - making token based governance particularly challenging. 

Airdrops do in theory create a larger, more democratic distribution, however in practice they lead to undesirable outcomes. Airdrops attract people who are not interested in the token's utility and are highly unlikely to become actual users. They are merely leeches, here for their _free_ tokens, ready to cash out at the first opportunity.

The Viewly Distribution Game is an attempt to create a **fair and effective token distribution**, where the tokens are _earned_ by actual Viewly users: <u>content creators and their supporters</u>. Because the users have to put in their time and effort to earn the tokens, they feel more ownership (endowment effect) as opposed to receiving tokens for _free_. 

Users can make use of their tokens on the Viewly Platform, as well as contribute a healthy representation in a token based governance process.



## Useful Proof of Work

Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains issue new tokens for proof-of-work mining, whereby scarce and expensive resources *(energy, hardware and labor)* are destroyed in exchange for a coin reward. 

Viewly is hosted on Ethereum, and has no consensus protocol to run. Therefore we can bind the token emissions to less quanitifiable and somewhat subjective type of work: human effort. 

The type of effort that is incentivized with the distribution game should benefit the network, and thus can be considered useful.



## Objectives

The purpose of the Viewly distribution game is to bootstrap the Viewly network by:

- Onboard successful content creators and their fans to the Viewly platform 
- Support high quality content production through VIEW Token emissions
- Distribute VIEW tokens to as many contributing Viewly users as possible
- Fairly reward skill and effort of the participants



## Game Duration

If the game proves to be effective at fullfilling its objectives, it shall run until up to **20M VIEW tokens** are released (as per the original Viewly Whitepaper of 2017). Current target duration is 2 years, although it is subject to change.

Once the Viewly network grows to a sufficiently large userbase, more scalable monetization methods such as social tipping (patronage), private channels and NFT's shall replace the distribution game as the main source of revenue for content creators.



## Stake vs identity based voting 

In *stake* based voting, each vote is based by VIEW token holdings of the voter. Voters with larger stakes thus have more voting power *(similar to traditional Proof of Stake systems)*. The stake based voting system is inspired by Steemit, however the actual implementation is different due to cheating concerns. **The stake based voting system is powering the Viewly video platform.**

Unlike the stake based system - where users are required to acquire tokens to have a voice - the identity based system gives every user equal average voting power. **The identity based system is powering the Viewly extension**, whereby the identity is borrowed from a an established source such as YouTube. This allows for a low friction onboarding process with a wide and diverse inclusion.
