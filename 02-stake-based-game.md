## Stake Based Game

The stake based game has taken significant inspiration from [Steem](https://steem.io/steem-bluepaper.pdf).

This game applies to [view.ly](https://view.ly).



### What is it?

The stake based game is a content subsidy program, in which creators who publish high quality content compete for votes from VIEW Token holders. The videos are rewarded with freshly minted VIEW Tokens in proportion to the cumulative stake of votes relative to all videos within a distribution period.



#### Key Concepts:

**Rewards Pool** is a daily allocation of VIEW Tokens to be given out to content creators.

**Period** is a 24 hour window which binds the videos published within said window to its respective rewards pool.

**Min Reward** is a threshold applied to *per video rewards*. Videos who's rewards don't meet the threshold have their rewrad nullified.
